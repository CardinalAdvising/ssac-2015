Sloan Sports Conf Paper
=======================

Potential Topics: 

1. Forecasting future performance based on collegiate information using KNN
2. How does where a player gets drafted impact development, success as a matching problem between player and organization

General Outline for Academic Paper:

1. Introduction

    - Describe managerial problem/issue
    - Define specific research question
    - Propose method for answering question and solving problem

2. Literature Review

    - Provide more context to the problem/issue
    - Familiarize with conversation regarding issue
    - Identify what questions have been asked, data has been used, methods implemented to shed light on issue

3. Contribution (Theory, Method, Data)

    - Identify primary contribution to conversation
    - Explain how it furthers knowledge of issue (better data, improved methods, unique perspective, relaxing assumption/generalizing current model)
    - Theoretical contributions focus on how some new ideas inform our perspective and why they might help explain the unknown

4. Methodology

    - What data are we using and how did we get it?
    - What analysis method are we using and why?
    - Implementation

5. Results

    - What did we learn
    - Did our model perform better than alternatives
    - Are we explaining more variance
    - Were our hypotheses correct

6. Discussion/Conclusion

    - now that we know the answer to the question, how should conversation evolve?
    - Strengths/weaknesses of approach
    - Potential Extenstions


Really what we need is to figure out how to hit on all three of these below within an interesting conversation.

1. New Data
2. New Method
3. New Approach/Theory
